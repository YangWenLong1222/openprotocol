# OpenProtocol Tooldata reader
Python Programm for Atlas Copco openprotocol!
With this protocol you can control screw installations that support the Openprotocol for several things. With this version we can only read the controller and tool data. This will be expanded as I have time. This has been tested on an Apple M1 as well as a windows PC.
The program itself is written in Python3 on the Google Colab platform and you can further find this code there.
Program needs arguments to connect to controller. Starting can be done in 2 ways.

Python openprotocol.py host port - "Python openprotocol.py 192.168.1.250 4545"

Or you can make an exe on a windows PC with auto-py-to-exe.
